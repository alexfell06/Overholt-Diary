            My dear <span class="persName">Sister</span>:
            
            
            <p>We are deeply shocked and pained to hear of the death of <span class="persName">Grace</span>. We had heard some time ago that she was ailing but presumed she
               had recovered.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>I am afraid it will not be possible for any of us to attend her funeral, as we are
               having so much trouble in the Coke region.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Your loss is a great one, but it is what we all have to <span class="unclear">??</span> to. <span class="persName">Ada</span>
               <span class="unclear">?? ??</span> tender sympathy and much love
