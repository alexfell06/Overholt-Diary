            <p> West Overton was a small Mennonite community located in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania
                that today is the location of <a href="https://www.westovertonvillage.org/">West
                    Overton Village and Museums</a>, a museum displaying the history and
                accomplishments of the people who lived there. The first family to settle in this
                village were the Overholts, led by Henry Kolb Overholt. They were a Mennonite family of
                German-Swiss heritage and Anabaptist religious roots. Henry Kolb's son Abraham began
                distilling and selling whiskey in the early nineteenth century, resulting in the
                Overholts becoming very wealthy. The focus of this project is a diary written by Karl
                Frick Overholt, one of the great-grandsons of Abraham Overholt. The contents of this
                diary include family stories, ancestry trees, diagrams, and newspaper clippings, among
                other things, making it an invaluable resource to the museum and interesting to analyze.
