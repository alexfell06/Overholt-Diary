               1860</span> to <span class="date">August 1862</span>.
            
            
            <p>After graduating from the Business College course, <span class="persName">father</span> went back home and worked in the West Overton Store at
               <span class="persName">C.S. Overholt's</span> place. <span class="persName">Lloyd
                  Shallenberger</span> ran the store, + <span class="persName">father</span>
               was only other clerk.
            </p>
            
            
            <p><span class="persName">Uncle Cris S. O.</span> was managing the West Overton
               Distillery for <span class="persName">Grandfather Abraham O.</span> and <span class="persName">"Uncle" Henry S. Overholt</span>.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>When the Civil War began, <span class="persName">father</span> + <span class="persName">Uncle Aaron</span> worked to enlist, but <span class="persName">Grandfather Bishop John D Overholt</span> did not want them to enlist right
               away, and forbade their so doing then.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>In the summer of <span class="date">1862</span>
               <span class="persName">Father</span> brought up the matter again, speaking to
               <span class="persName">Uncle Aaron</span> about it, who thought it would be of
               no avail to ask JDO again.
            </p>
            
            
            <p><span class="pagenum">189</span>However <span class="persName">father</span>
               said that he was going to ask <span class="persName">his father JDO</span> and was
               going to insist upon enlisting + getting <span class="persName">JDO's</span>
               consent.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>When approached <span class="persName">JDO</span> first remonstrated as before in
               <span class="date">'61</span>, but finally consented. <span class="persName">JDO</span> of course was in favor of the War. No one was prouder of his sons
               + their being in the Service than he. Every day he would go to the West Overton
               <span class="abbr">P.O.</span> for his "Philadelphia Inquirer" paper, to get the news of the
               War.
