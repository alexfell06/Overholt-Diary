               <span class="placeName">Broadford</span> to see him. He suggested that they buy a coal
               tract of 150 acres from <span class="persName">John Rist</span>, in payment in which
               each should give a <span class="unclear">??</span> for $13,000.00.

            <p>During excavation work for the ovens, 25 or 30 men were almost burned alive, being

            <p>This incident, together with the uncertain times, induced <span class="persName">Father</span> to resign + sell out his interest (<span class="persName">Uncle
