         <p><span class="persName">Uncle Clay's</span> first coal purchase was at

         <p><span class="persName">Uncle Clay</span> sent word to <span class="placeName">West
               Overton</span> to <span class="persName">Father</span> to come to
            <span class="placeName">Broadford</span> to see him. He suggested that they buy a coal
            tract of 150 acres from <span class="persName">John Rist</span>, in payment in which
            each should give a <span class="unclear">??</span> for $13,000.00.

            the management + the firm was styled "Overholt, Frick + Co"

         <p><span class="pagenum">227</span>Fifty ovens were first constructed, called "Novelty Works."
         </p>
         
         
         <p>During excavation work for the ovens, 25 or 30 men were almost burned alive, being
            saved in the nick of time by <span class="persName">Fathers</span> calling to them
            in time.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>This incident, together with the uncertain times, induced <span class="persName">Father</span> to resign + sell out his interest (<span class="persName">Uncle
               Clay</span> buying 1/2 of it, + <span class="persName">A.O. Tinstman</span>
            the other 1/2).

         <p><span class="persName">Father</span> retired from the firm, "O, F. + CO." on <span class="date">June 20, '71</span>, + the firm became known thereafter as

         <p><span class="persName">Father</span> then remarked how <span class="unclear">??</span> far sighted <span class="persName">Uncle Clay</span> was, far
            above everyone else.
