         <span class="pagenum">184</span>School Days
         
         
         <p>Went to the West Overton School (at crest of hill east of town) until about 20
            <span class="abbr">yrs.</span> of age.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Farm Days</p>
         
         
         <p>Worked on farm in summer + took care of stock in winter. In <span class="date">1859</span>
            <span class="persName">his father</span> entered into an agreement with him whereby
            <span class="persName">JRSO</span> was to manage the farm, and in return
            <span class="persName">his father</span> was to board him, provide all farm
            utensils + seeds etc, + to give him 1/3rd of all crops.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>There was a big frost that year, and the crops were a failure. <span class="persName">His father</span>, however, said that he should have something, and he paid
            him $300.00
